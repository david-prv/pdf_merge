I hated using online tools for merging my PDF files so I wrote a simple Python 3.6 script to merge all PDF files in a folder to a new PDF file.

# Usage
1. Put the script and the pdf files you want to merge in the same folder.  
2. Run the script.  
3. Double check if folder is correct, otherwise choose another
4. Define merge order in GUI (Drag them with your mouse)
5. The merged pdf will be created as OUTPUT.pdf  

# Installation
```
pip install pikepdf
git clone https://github.com/david-prv/pdf_merge 
```
